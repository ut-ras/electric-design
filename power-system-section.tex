\subsection{Power Distrobution System}
The power system on Rasputin was designed to make it easy to charge and to isolate the sensitive electonics, like the GPS, from the powerline noise caused by driving motors.
To isolate the electronics from the motors, we simply used seperate lead-acid batteries for both systems and opto-isolated motor drivers.
Our charging circuit uses five double pull double throw relays to switch between running mode, normally connected, and charging mode, normally open.
The relays are all powered by a AC to DC converter so that they will switch to charging mode when pulgged in.
A diagram of the relay system is provided as figure \ref{relay-diagram} and of the system as a wholeis provided in figure \ref{power-distrobution-diagram}.
